# FusionVision
This project integrates advanced computer vision techniques into a single interactive web application. 
Its objective is to demonstrate real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model and synthetic image generation with a simple GAN architecture. Users can upload images to detect and annotate objects, while also generating novel images from random noise. The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for easy experimentation and visualization. Key requirements include Python, PyTorch, Torchvision, Ultralytics YOLO, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, and Streamlit. This project serves as a hands-on example of merging detection and generative modeling for innovative computer vision solutions effectively.
