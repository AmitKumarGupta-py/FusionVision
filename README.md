#YOLOVision

This project integrates advanced computer vision techniques into an interactive web application, focusing on real-time object detection using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model. Users can upload images to detect and annotate objects efficiently. The application is deployed using Streamlit, ensuring a user-friendly interface for seamless experimentation and visualization. Key dependencies include Python, PyTorch, Torchvision, Ultralytics YOLO, OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow, and Streamlit. This project serves as a practical demonstration of real-time object detection, showcasing the effectiveness of YOLO for various computer vision applications.
